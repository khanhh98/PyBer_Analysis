## Overview
### Purpose
  - Create summary report to show the different weekly fares for each city type in order to suggest business recommendations for the CEO
### Results
#### Metrics per city:
  - Urban cities
    + Average driver count: 24
    + Average fare per ride: $24.52 
    + Total ride: 1625
    + Total fare: $39,854.38  
  - Suburban
    + Average driver count: 14
    + Average fare per ride: $31
    + Total ride: 625
    + Total fare: $19,356.33
  - Rural 
    + Average driver count: 4
    + Average fare per ride: $33.9
    + Total ride: 125
    + Total fare: $4237.93
### Summary
#### Recommendations:
  - We can clearly see the disparities of total fare within different type of cities, hence the company might want to delegate more resources toward the profitable region which is Urban cities.
  - The rural cities has the lowest average driver count with the least total fare, therefore it offers huge opportunity for the company to expand the market there. Highly recommended the CEO to look into it.
  - The company only has 2.6% of total drivers which seems too unbalance, hence recommend to increase the rural drivers to order better service for the customers
